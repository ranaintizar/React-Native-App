# React-Native-App

This is a mobile application built in React Native using Expo. The app is designed to be cross-platform and can run on both iOS and Android devices. The project includes all the necessary code, assets, and dependencies needed to run the application.

The app is built with React Native, which is a popular JavaScript framework for building mobile applications. React Native allows developers to create native applications using a single codebase, which makes it easier and faster to develop mobile apps.

Expo is a set of tools and services that makes it easier to build, deploy, and manage React Native applications. It provides a set of libraries and APIs that simplify the development process and allows developers to focus on building the app's functionality rather than worrying about the underlying technical details.

This repository includes all the necessary files to run the application, including the source code, dependencies, and assets. It also includes documentation on how to set up and run the app. Developers can use this repository as a starting point for building their own React Native applications using Expo.
